# env-test

A reproducibility test!

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. Open the R project in Rstudio
3. Install the `renv` R package if you have not already
4. use `renv::restore()` to install (fingers crossed!) the R *and* Python packages you need
5. Run `make-things.R` and see if you can produce the word cloud and parts of speech table
